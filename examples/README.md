# AMBIT with Docker examples
| Example | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [echa-reach](echa-reach/README.md) | The [Cefic-LRI](http://cefic-lri.org/toolbox/ambit/) cheminformatics data management tool. Note that the database of over 450,000 chemical structures and the REACH dataset of 14,570 substances are **not included**. If you are a Cefic member, you can download them from the Cefic members extranet. |
| [empty-db](empty-db/README.md) | Shows how to start AMBIT with an empty database, mainly for populating it with your own data or testing of the generic AMBIT functionality. |
| [empty-db-solr](empty-db-solr/README.md) | Builds upon the empty database example by adding a small Apache Solr cluster for testing.
